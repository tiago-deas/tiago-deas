<p align="center">In December 2013, I graduated in <b>Petroleum Engineering</b> from the University Centre of Barra Mansa and started working the following year as a <b><i>GIS assistant</i></b> at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). I stayed there for 3 years, during which time I obtained my second degree in <b><i>Health and Safety Engineering</i></b> at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. In Brazil, a postgraduate degree in Health and Safety Engineering is equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, due to a specificity in the H&S field in the country.<p>

<p align="center">I moved to <b><i>Auckland in New Zealand</i></b>, after the end of my contract with IBGE in August 2017, to pursue a <b><i>Graduate Diploma in International Business Innovation</i></b> at ICL Graduate Business School. It was a one-year program where I had the opportunity to learn concepts related to the business world while developing, in another language, my background in the field.</p>

<p align="center">I lived in the country for 4 years and it was certainly a life-changing experience as New Zealand is a multicultural place with people from all over the world and this taught me a lot about respect, tolerance, and empathy. During my stay, I <b><i>worked in many different areas</i></b>, especially at <b><i>events</i></b>. This allowed me to improve some important and valuable soft skills such as leadership, customer service, and communication. I am currently <b><i>fluent in English</i></b> thanks to the time spent in Aotearoa (the current MƒÅori name for New Zealand).</p>

<p align="center">In September 2021, I decided to move back to Brazil to pursue a new career path. IT was something I had always been interested in, as it was my second option before I started studying engineering. With this in mind, I started planning a career path in IT and I found out <b><i>Data Science</i></B> is the field I like the most because I love to clean, manipulate and visualize data. Moreover, I believe that all the skills I got throughout all my academic and professional years can help me lead my career as a Data Scientist because professionals in this field need to have multitasking skills. To achieve my current career goals, I am studying for an <b><i>MBA in Data Science and Analytics</i></b> at the University of S√£o Paulo, and at the same time, studying to become a <b><i>Full Stack Developer</i></b> at the National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI) because I think it is very important to have a <b></i>programming background</i><b> and this is another field that I am pretty interested in and passionate about.</p>
